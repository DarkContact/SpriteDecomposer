# [Sprite Decomposer](https://github.com/eriknelson/SpriteDecomposer)
A Github hosted fork of [this upstream project](http://sourceforge.net/projects/spritedecompose/),
originally developed by [Nicolas Smeets](http://www.creacore.be/blog/).

This project has been ported to use QT5, requiring minor source modification. The sourceforge
hosted project seemingly does not run on OS X 10.9.x (Mavericks), and I assume it will fail to run
on 10.10.x (Yosemite) as well. This fork is intended to provide a working version for Mavericks. It has
not been tested on Yosemite.

Feel free to file issues for problems you may come accross, or submit a PR.
